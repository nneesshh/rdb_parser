/* The ziplist is a specially encoded dually linked list that is designed
* to be very memory efficient. It stores both strings and integer values,
* where integers are encoded as actual integers instead of a series of
* characters. It allows push and pop operations on either side of the list
* in O(1) time. However, because every operation requires a reallocation of
* the memory used by the ziplist, the actual complexity is related to the
* amount of memory used by the ziplist.
*
* ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
*
* ZIPLIST OVERALL LAYOUT
* ======================
*
* The general layout of the ziplist is as follows:
*
* <zlbytes> <zltail> <zllen> <entry> <entry> ... <entry> <zlend>
*
* NOTE: all fields are stored in little endian, if not specified otherwise.
*
* <uint32_t zlbytes> is an unsigned integer to hold the number of bytes that
* the ziplist occupies, including the four bytes of the zlbytes field itself.
* This value needs to be stored to be able to resize the entire structure
* without the need to traverse it first.
*
* <uint32_t zltail> is the offset to the last entry in the list. This allows
* a pop operation on the far side of the list without the need for full
* traversal.
*
* <uint16_t zllen> is the number of entries. When there are more than
* 2^16-2 entries, this value is set to 2^16-1 and we need to traverse the
* entire list to know how many items it holds.
*
* <uint8_t zlend> is a special entry representing the end of the ziplist.
* Is encoded as a single byte equal to 255. No other normal entry starts
* with a byte set to the value of 255.
*
* ZIPLIST ENTRIES
* ===============
*
* Every entry in the ziplist is prefixed by metadata that contains two pieces
* of information. First, the length of the previous entry is stored to be
* able to traverse the list from back to front. Second, the entry encoding is
* provided. It represents the entry type, integer or string, and in the case
* of strings it also represents the length of the string payload.
* So a complete entry is stored like this:
*
* <prevlen> <encoding> <entry-data>
*
* Sometimes the encoding represents the entry itself, like for small integers
* as we'll see later. In such a case the <entry-data> part is missing, and we
* could have just:
*
* <prevlen> <encoding>
*
* The length of the previous entry, <prevlen>, is encoded in the following way:
* If this length is smaller than 254 bytes, it will only consume a single
* byte representing the length as an unsinged 8 bit integer. When the length
* is greater than or equal to 254, it will consume 5 bytes. The first byte is
* set to 254 (FE) to indicate a larger value is following. The remaining 4
* bytes take the length of the previous entry as value.
*
* So practically an entry is encoded in the following way:
*
* <prevlen from 0 to 253> <encoding> <entry>
*
* Or alternatively if the previous entry length is greater than 253 bytes
* the following encoding is used:
*
* 0xFE <4 bytes unsigned little endian prevlen> <encoding> <entry>
*
* The encoding field of the entry depends on the content of the
* entry. When the entry is a string, the first 2 bits of the encoding first
* byte will hold the type of encoding used to store the length of the string,
* followed by the actual length of the string. When the entry is an integer
* the first 2 bits are both set to 1. The following 2 bits are used to specify
* what kind of integer will be stored after this header. An overview of the
* different types and encodings is as follows. The first byte is always enough
* to determine the kind of entry.
*
* |00pppppp| - 1 byte
*      String value with length less than or equal to 63 bytes (6 bits).
*      "pppppp" represents the unsigned 6 bit length.
* |01pppppp|qqqqqqqq| - 2 bytes
*      String value with length less than or equal to 16383 bytes (14 bits).
*      IMPORTANT: The 14 bit number is stored in big endian.
* |10000000|qqqqqqqq|rrrrrrrr|ssssssss|tttttttt| - 5 bytes
*      String value with length greater than or equal to 16384 bytes.
*      Only the 4 bytes following the first byte represents the length
*      up to 32^2-1. The 6 lower bits of the first byte are not used and
*      are set to zero.
*      IMPORTANT: The 32 bit number is stored in big endian.
* |11000000| - 3 bytes
*      Integer encoded as int16_t (2 bytes).
* |11010000| - 5 bytes
*      Integer encoded as int32_t (4 bytes).
* |11100000| - 9 bytes
*      Integer encoded as int64_t (8 bytes).
* |11110000| - 4 bytes
*      Integer encoded as 24 bit signed (3 bytes).
* |11111110| - 2 bytes
*      Integer encoded as 8 bit signed (1 byte).
* |1111xxxx| - (with xxxx between 0000 and 1101) immediate 4 bit integer.
*      Unsigned integer from 0 to 12. The encoded value is actually from
*      1 to 13 because 0000 and 1111 can not be used, so 1 should be
*      subtracted from the encoded 4 bit value to obtain the right value.
* |11111111| - End of ziplist special entry.
*
* Like for the ziplist header, all the integers are represented in little
* endian byte order, even when this code is compiled in big endian systems.
*
* EXAMPLES OF ACTUAL ZIPLISTS
* ===========================
*
* The following is a ziplist containing the two elements representing
* the strings "2" and "5". It is composed of 15 bytes, that we visually
* split into sections:
*
*  [0f 00 00 00] [0c 00 00 00] [02 00] [00 f3] [02 f6] [ff]
*        |             |          |       |       |     |
*     zlbytes        zltail    entries   "2"     "5"   end
*
* The first 4 bytes represent the number 15, that is the number of bytes
* the whole ziplist is composed of. The second 4 bytes are the offset
* at which the last ziplist entry is found, that is 12, in fact the
* last entry, that is "5", is at offset 12 inside the ziplist.
* The next 16 bit integer represents the number of elements inside the
* ziplist, its value is 2 since there are just two elements inside.
* Finally "00 f3" is the first entry representing the number 2. It is
* composed of the previous entry length, which is zero because this is
* our first entry, and the byte F3 which corresponds to the encoding
* |1111xxxx| with xxxx between 0001 and 1101. We need to remove the "F"
* higher order bits 1111, and subtract 1 from the "3", so the entry value
* is "2". The next entry has a prevlen of 02, since the first entry is
* composed of exactly two bytes. The entry itself, F6, is encoded exactly
* like the first entry, and 6-1 = 5, so the value of the entry is 5.
* Finally the special entry FF signals the end of the ziplist.
*
* Adding another element to the above string with the value "Hello World"
* allows us to show how the ziplist encodes small strings. We'll just show
* the hex dump of the entry itself. Imagine the bytes as following the
* entry that stores "5" in the ziplist above:
*
* [02] [0b] [48 65 6c 6c 6f 20 57 6f 72 6c 64]
*
* The first byte, 02, is the length of the previous entry. The next
* byte represents the encoding in the pattern |00pppppp| that means
* that the entry is a string of length <pppppp>, so 0B means that
* an 11 bytes string follows. From the third byte (48) to the last (64)
* there are just the ASCII characters for "Hello World".
